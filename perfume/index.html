            <P>
                I, Prathish S R, Roll No. RA2411004010648, a student of B.Tech ECE – Section K at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, am writing this letter to inform you about my pending fee payment status.

I would like to mention that I have already obtained permission from the Dean, and I was advised to submit an official request to your department for record purposes.

Due to certain financial constraints, I have not been able to clear the remaining portion of my college fees. I have currently paid ₹1,80,000 out of the total ₹2,75,000. I assure you that the remaining amount will be paid on or before February without fail.
            </P>
